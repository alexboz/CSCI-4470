# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

## 3. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
Choosing a license is important since you want to ensure that your software has a clearly defined set of rights for its users. With free software, you want to make sure that it remains free and/or open source, including derivative works if you desire. For commercial software, a license is an important part of ensuring that the software retains its commercial viability, and isn't used as part of a competing solution or made public. By not choosing a license, the project is by default copyrighted by its creator, limiting its ability to be utilized.

## 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
If a project doesn't have an explicit license, then it is by default covered by copyright law, which means that all rights are reserved. If you incorporate this project into your own work, then the owner of that project could come after you unless you had their explicit permission to use the project. In addition, by not having a license the copyright is held by all contributors of the project which makes it problematic to add a license later on.

## 5. Do you agree with this claim?
I agree that the developers of Gopher failed to follow the open systems model. By not opening the protocol early on to incorporate others' ideas, forking was inevitable and there was limited chance of widespread adoption like with HTTP, a necessity for something as large as the web. In addition, creating a licensing fee that only applies to commercial entities creates divide between who is able to use the software and who is not, which also limits widespread adoption.

## 6. License Justification
Android (the userspace portion) is Apache 2.0 licensed due to the goal and philosophy of the project, which is about freedom and choice. They state that the purpose of Android is to promote openness in the mobile world and that modification is encouraged, but open modifications should not be required. This is why they went with Apache over something like GPL.
